I am a postdoctoral researcher at the
  [Laboratoire Méthodes Formelles][https://lmf.cnrs.fr/] (LMF) 
at 
  [ENS Paris-Saclay][https://ens-paris-saclay.fr/], 
working within the research group 
  [Deducteam][deducteam.github.io]. 

I am interested in mathematical and computational structures that representing mathematics.
In particular, I have a special interest in the intersection of type-theoretic 
and set-theoretic technqiues for interactive theorem proving.

Currently, I'm working on translating specifications and proofs from 
[SMT solvers][https://smt-lib.org/] (in particular, [cvc5][https://cvc5.github.io/])
to the proof assistant [Lambdapi][https://github.com/Deducteam/lambdapi].
