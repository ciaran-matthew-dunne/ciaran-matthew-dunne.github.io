I am a postdoctoral researcher working within the
research group [Deducteam](https://deducteam.gitlabpages.inria.fr/).

My research centers around the development of mathematical and
computational structures for automated reasoning.
In particular, I have a special interest in combining
type-theoretic and set-theoretic techniques for
interactive theorem proving.

Since June 2024, I have been working on a project
supported by the [ANR](https://anr.fr/en/anrs-role-in-research/about-us/missions/)
mission [ICSPA](https://anr.fr/Project-ANR-21-CE25-0015)
for automated reconstruction of proofs traces
generated by the industrial verification tool [Atelier-B](https://www.atelierb.eu/en/).

From April 2024 to April 2025, I worked on a project
supported by an [Amazon Research Award](https://www.amazon.science/research-awards)
for translating proof certificates from [SMT solvers](https://smt-lib.org/)
to the proof assistant [LambdaPi](https://github.com/Deducteam/lambdapi).
This work led to the development of a tool
[`eo2lp`](https://github.com/ciaran-matthew-dunne/eo2lp/)
for translating signatures and proofs from [Eunoia](https://github.com/cvc5/ethos/blob/main/user_manual.md)
to LambdaPi, which is discussed in the following [draft](https://hal.science/file/index/docid/5361775/filename/eo2lp.pdf).
